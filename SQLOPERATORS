#customers who are located in the USA or France
SELECT customername, country

#The following query will return the customer's records who are located in the USA
#or France and have credit limits greater than 100,000

#Suppose you want to find products whose buy prices are within the ranges
#of 90 and 100. You can use the BETWEEN operator, as in the following query:

SELECT productCode,productName,buyPrice FROM products
where buyPrice between 90 and 100;

#To find the product whose buy price is not between $20 and $100, you can
#combine the BETWEEN operator with the NOT operator as follows:

SELECT productCode,productName,buyPrice FROM products
where buyPrice not between 20 and 100;

#The following query uses the IS NULL operator to find customers who do not
#have a sales representative

SELECT customerName,country, salesRepEmployeeNumber FROM customers where salesRepEmployeeNumber IS NULL order by customerName;

#The below query uses the IS NOT NULL operator to get the customers who
#have a sales representative:
SELECT customerName,country, salesRepEmployeeNumber FROM customers where salesRepEmployeeNumber IS not NULL order by customerName;

#The following query uses the LEFT JOIN predicate and the IS NULL operator
#to find customers who have no order:

SELECT C.customerNumber,C.customerName,C.country,O.customerNumber FROM customers C LEFT JOIN orders O ON C.customerNumber=O.customerNumber
WHERE O.customerNumber IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM orders;
